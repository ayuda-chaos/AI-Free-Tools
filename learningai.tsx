    coreLesson:
      'AI is pattern recognition trained on human knowledge. You already use pattern recognition every day: recognizing faces, understanding language, making decisions. AI just does it faster.',
    deeperTruth:
      'Many people force themselves to learn because they fear being left behind. This creates resistance. Instead, approach AI from curiosity: "What becomes possible if I understand this?" When you love learning itself, not the outcome, the struggle disappears.',
    whatYouDo: [
      'Use Arena.ai or Claude (free accounts) to have a conversation.',
      'Ask it to explain something you are genuinely curious about.',
      'Notice: You are already using AI. The barrier was never your capability; it was your belief about your capability.'

      'Before moving forward, ask yourself: "Am I learning this because I am afraid of falling behind, or because I am genuinely curious?" Neither is wrong, but knowing the difference changes everything.'

    title: 'Training Your AI Thinking (How to Ask Better Questions)',
    coreLesson:
      'AI is only as good as your questions. Learning to prompt AI is learning to think clearly about what you actually want.',
    deeperTruth:
      'Most people struggle with AI because they struggle with clarity in general. "Make me a website" is vague. "Create a one-page portfolio website with my name, three project descriptions, and a contact form" is clear. AI forces you to know what you want, which is valuable far beyond technology.',
    whatYouDo: [
      'Start with a vague question: "Help me with my business."',
      'Watch AI struggle to help you.',

    title: 'Creating Real Content (Writing, Images, Ideas)',
    coreLesson:
      'AI can generate text, images, presentations, and more. But it cannot generate your voice or your perspective; it can only amplify it.',
    deeperTruth:
      'Many people fear AI will replace them. But AI without human direction is like a piano without a pianist: capable, but purposeless. You are the consciousness that gives AI meaning. When you understand this, you stop competing with AI and start collaborating with it.',

    deeperTruth:
      'Technology is neutral. A knife can prepare food or cause harm. AI can educate or manipulate. The difference is not the tool; it is the consciousness wielding it. When you love yourself and others, you naturally use AI responsibly. When you are disconnected, you use it for ego or harm.',
